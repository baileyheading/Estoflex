Estoflex' : The Estonian Inflections Tool

Available at: https://estoflex.com/ with Android and ios apps coming soon.

The Estonian Inflections tool is an app to provide learners of the estonian language a simplified and highly accessible way to analyse and understand the complexities of estonian inflected words, prior to the point where you have memorised how to form the inflections for all 14 cases.

It is based on the projects https://github.com/Filosoft/vabamorf and https://github.com/estnltk/pyvabamorf respectively.
