Estoflex' : The Estonian Inflections Tool

Available at: https://estoflex.com/ with Android and iOS apps coming soon.

The Estonian Inflections tool is an app to provide learners of the estonian language a simplified and highly accessible way to analyse and understand the complexities of estonian inflected words, prior to the point where you have memorised how to form the inflections for all 14 cases.

It is based on the projects https://github.com/Filosoft/vabamorf and https://github.com/estnltk/pyvabamorf.

Simply enter any word form and the tool will provide the lemma (dictionary form), case, number, and a basic english translation of the lemma (limited by what is available in the current dictionary). Verb tenses and phonetic breakdowns (syllables and IPA) are currently unsupported, but are on the way.
